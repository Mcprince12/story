**Story**

Once upon a time in a forest, there lived a monkey who resided on a jamun tree  which was on the bank of the river. 
In the same forest there lived a crocodile and his wife. One day the crocodile came to the banks of the river and rested 
under the tree. The kind hearted monkey offered him some fruits. The crocodile came back the next day from the woods as 
he loved them. As days passed by, the crocodile and the monkey became good friends.
